# Next.js & Express.js Full Stack Application

## Description:

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. It serves client-side React components with Next.js and handles server-side logic using Express.js.

## Features:

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **Express.js** for backend API handling and custom server logic.
- Full stack integration with seamless communication between client and server.
- RESTful APIs powered by Express.js.

## Technologies:

- **Next.js 14**: React-based framework for frontend.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization.
- **PostgreSQL** (optional): Database support.

## Prerequisites:

- **Node.js** (14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** for managing packages
- **Git** for version control
